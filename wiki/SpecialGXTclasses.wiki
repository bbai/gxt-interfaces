#summary The following classes from the GXT library are not testable from the point of view of this lightweight library.
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

= Reasons and justifications =
The reasons some classes from the GXT framework do not have corresponding interfaces and implementations in the gxt-interfaces library is their intrinsic design. These classes are not extendable, thus excluding them from being candidates for testing. 

= Details =
A quick list of just some of these classes (work in progress): 
*ColumnFooter
*Foot
*FooterRow
*Document
*HeaderItem
*FramePanel

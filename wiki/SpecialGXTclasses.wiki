#summary The following classes from the GXT library are not testable from the point of view of this lightweight library.
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

= Reasons and justifications =
The reasons some classes from the GXT framework do not have corresponding interfaces and implementations in the gxt-interfaces library is their intrinsic design. These classes are not extendable, thus excluding them from being candidates for testing. 

= Details =
The following is a quick list of just some of these classes (work in progress):
(Component)
  * DataListItem - deprecated
  * DataViewItem - deprecated
  * FramePanel - private constructor
  * HeaderItem - inner class
